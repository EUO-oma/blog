# Who are U

Who are U > is lost & trying to build a CPT of yrself iOt be found?
This (Q) represents the Ess of SPIR. U`ll never find yrself  in what U `ve built to define yself.

U’re t 1 who’s doing the building.
U may assemble the most amazing collection of thoughts and emotions;
U may build a truly beautiful, unbelievable, interesting, and dynamic structure;
but, obviously, it’s not U.

U = the 1 who did this. U are the 1 who was L, S, & Cnfused because U focused yr AWN away frm yr AWN of Self. In this panic, in this lost state, U learned to cling&hold onto the THO&EMO that were passing before U.
U used them to build a Psnlt, a Persn, a self-concept that would allow U to define yrself . AWN rested itself on the objects it was aware of and called it home.

Because_U have this 模型 of who U are, it is easier to know how to act, how to 
make decisions, and how to relate to the outside world. : If U dare to look, u ll see
that U live yr entire life based on the 模型 U built around yrself
